# dpdkpython
 Here's the example of using the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) in Python
 In this example:

We load the DPDK library using ctypes.
We initialize DPDK using dpdk.rte_eal_init. The ctypes.c_int(0) parameter specifies the argc (argument count) as 0, and None represents argv (argument vector), indicating that DPDK should use default arguments.
We configure the network interface using dpdk.rte_eth_dev_configure. You should fill in the configuration parameters as needed for your application.
We start the network interface with dpdk.rte_eth_dev_start.
The actual network operations in DPDK are complex and application-specific. We have simplified this section with a comment to indicate that real-world DPDK code would include network-specific functionality.
Finally, we clean up DPDK resources using dpdk.rte_eal_cleanup.
